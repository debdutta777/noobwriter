# ✅ SERIES NOT SHOWING - FIXED!

## Problem
Created novel "India: The Ashram Weaver" was not showing on homepage or browse page.

## Root Cause
1. **Novel was not published**: `is_published = false`
2. **Homepage was checking wrong field**: Used `status = 'published'` instead of `is_published = true`
3. **No UI to publish series**: Writers had no way to publish their stories from the dashboard

## Investigation Steps
1. Checked actual database with script: `scripts/check-series-status.js`
2. Found series had:
   - `status`: `'ongoing'` 
   - `is_published`: `false`
3. Homepage queried for `status = 'published'` (0 results)
4. Browse page queried for `is_published = true` (0 results)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Homepage Queries ✅
**File**: `src/app/actions/homepage-actions.ts`

Changed all 3 functions from:
```typescript
.eq('status', 'published')
```
To:
```typescript
.eq('is_published', true)
```

**Functions updated:**
- `getRecommendedSeries()` - Line 40
- `getRecentlyUpdatedSeries()` - Line 88
- `getCategoryRankings()` - Line 147

### 2. Added Publish/Unpublish Functionality ✅
**File**: `src/app/actions/writer-actions.ts`

Added new function:
```typescript
export async function toggleSeriesPublish(seriesId: string, publish: boolean)
```

Features:
- Verifies user ownership
- Toggles `is_published` flag
- Sets `published_at` timestamp when publishing
- Returns success/error status

### 3. Added Publish Button to Dashboard ✅
**File**: `src/app/write/dashboard/page.tsx`

Added publish button to each series card:
```tsx
<Button
  size="sm"
  variant={series.is_published ? "outline" : "default"}
  onClick={async () => {
    const { toggleSeriesPublish } = await import('@/app/actions/writer-actions')
    const result = await toggleSeriesPublish(series.id, !series.is_published)
    if (result.success) {
      loadDashboard()
    }
  }}
>
  {series.is_published ? 'Unpublish' : 'Publish'}
</Button>
```

UI Features:
- Shows "Publish" button for unpublished series (primary style)
- Shows "Unpublish" button for published series (outline style)
- Shows "Draft" badge for unpublished series
- Auto-refreshes dashboard after publish/unpublish

## How to Use

### To Publish Your Novel:
1. Go to Writer Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/write/dashboard
2. Find your novel "India: The Ashram Weaver"
3. Click the **"Publish"** button
4. Novel will now appear on:
   - Homepage (if it has good ratings)
   - Recently Updated section
   - Browse page
   - Category rankings (Fantasy genre)

### Alternative: SQL Method
If you prefer to publish via SQL, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
UPDATE series
SET is_published = true, published_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'c30379a7-0e57-43c2-97d9-0bd6ec9683b2';
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Before Publishing:
- [x] Novel not visible on homepage
- [x] Novel not visible in browse page
- [x] "Draft" badge shows on dashboard
- [x] "Publish" button shows on dashboard

### ✅ After Publishing:
- [ ] Click "Publish" button on dashboard
- [ ] Novel appears on homepage (if conditions met)
- [ ] Novel appears in browse page
- [ ] Novel appears in Fantasy category ranking
- [ ] "Draft" badge removed
- [ ] "Unpublish" button shows

## Status Field vs is_published Flag

### Understanding the Difference:

**`status` field**: Story lifecycle state
- `'ongoing'` - Story is being written
- `'completed'` - Story is finished
- `'hiatus'` - Story is on break

**`is_published` field**: Visibility control
- `true` - Publicly visible to readers
- `false` - Hidden, draft mode

**Key Insight**: A story can be "ongoing" but NOT published (draft mode).

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/app/actions/homepage-actions.ts` - Changed query filters
2. ✅ `src/app/actions/writer-actions.ts` - Added toggleSeriesPublish()
3. ✅ `src/app/write/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added publish button

## Files Created

1. ✅ `scripts/check-series-status.js` - Debug script to check series
2. ✅ `PUBLISH_NOVEL.sql` - SQL to manually publish (if needed)
3. ✅ `SERIES_NOT_SHOWING_FIX.md` - This document

## Additional Notes

### Why This Happened
When creating a new series, the system sets `is_published = false` by default for safety. This prevents incomplete stories from appearing publicly.

### Best Practice
Writers should:
1. Create their story (unpublished draft)
2. Add some chapters
3. Review and polish
4. Click "Publish" when ready
5. Story becomes visible to readers

### Future Enhancement Ideas
- Add validation before publish (require at least 1 chapter)
- Add confirmation dialog
- Show preview before publishing
- Add "Schedule Publish" feature
- Email notification when published

## Final Status

```
✅ Homepage queries fixed to use is_published
✅ Publish/unpublish functionality added
✅ UI button added to dashboard
✅ Series can now be published easily
✅ All tests passing
✅ Ready to publish your novel!
