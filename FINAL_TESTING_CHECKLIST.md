## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### The Core Problem
The database had been updated with new column names, but the code was still using old names from an earlier version:

**Before (Wrong):**
```typescript
- series.view_count (doesn't exist)
- series.cover_image_url (doesn't exist)  
- series.description (mostly empty)
- series.avg_rating (doesn't exist)
- chapters.views (doesn't exist)
```

**After (Correct):**
```typescript
- series.total_views ✅
- series.cover_url ✅
- series.synopsis ✅  
- series.average_rating ✅
- chapters.view_count ✅
```

### The Solution
Used the Supabase check script to verify actual database schema, then updated all 9 files to use the correct column names.

## ✅ Final Status

```
