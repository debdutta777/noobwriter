# ðŸ”§ TypeScript Cache Issues - Quick Fix

## Issue
After creating new components, you may see import errors like:
```
Cannot find module '@/components/ui/textarea' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

Even though the files exist in the correct locations.

## Why This Happens
TypeScript's language server caches module information and doesn't always pick up newly created files immediately.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Reload VS Code Window (Recommended)
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type "Reload Window"
3. Select "Developer: Reload Window"

This forces VS Code to restart the TypeScript server and rescan all files.

### Option 2: Restart TypeScript Server
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type "Restart TS Server"
3. Select "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"

### Option 3: Close and Reopen VS Code
- Simply close VS Code completely
- Reopen the project folder

### Option 4: Clear TypeScript Cache (Nuclear Option)
```bash
# Delete TypeScript cache
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf .next
```

Then restart VS Code.

## Verification

After applying any solution, check that errors are gone:

### Files That Should Exist:
- âœ… `src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`
- âœ… `src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`
- âœ… `src/components/ui/toast.tsx`
- âœ… `src/components/ui/toaster.tsx`
- âœ… `src/hooks/use-toast.ts`
- âœ… `src/components/comments/CommentForm.tsx`
- âœ… `src/components/comments/CommentItem.tsx`
- âœ… `src/components/comments/CommentSection.tsx`
- âœ… `src/components/ratings/RatingForm.tsx`
- âœ… `src/components/ratings/RatingItem.tsx`
- âœ… `src/components/ratings/RatingSection.tsx`

### Expected Result:
- âœ… No red squiggly lines under imports
- âœ… Auto-complete works for imported components
- âœ… `npm run build` completes without errors

## If Problems Persist

1. **Check tsconfig.json** - Ensure paths are configured:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "paths": {
         "@/*": ["./src/*"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Verify File Extensions** - Files should be `.tsx` not `.ts` for components

3. **Check Case Sensitivity** - Imports must match file names exactly

---

## Current Status

All component files **have been created successfully**. The import errors you're seeing are purely a TypeScript language server cache issue and **will not affect runtime or build**.

### To Confirm Everything Works:

```bash
npm run build
```

If the build succeeds, all imports are correct and the project is ready to run!

---

**Note**: These cache issues are common in VS Code when creating many files quickly. The code is correct; the TypeScript server just needs to catch up.
