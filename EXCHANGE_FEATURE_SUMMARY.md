# Feature Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Dashboard Tips Display

**Issue:** Dashboard wasn't showing actual tip data received by authors

**Solution:** Added "Recent Tips Received" section to writer dashboard

**Implementation:**
- Modified `src/app/actions/writer-actions.ts` to fetch recent tips
- Updated `src/app/write/dashboard/page.tsx` to display tips with:
  - Tipper name (from metadata)
  - Tip amount
  - Series title
  - Timestamp
  - Beautiful pink gradient design with Heart icon

**Query:**
```typescript
const { data: tips } = await supabase
  .from('transactions')
  .select('id, coin_amount, description, created_at, metadata')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .eq('type', 'tip')
  .gte('coin_amount', 0)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(10)
```

**Display:** Shows up to 10 most recent tips with:
- "+{amount} coins from {reader_name}"
- Series name
- Date and time
- Pink themed cards

### 2. Wallet Coin-to-INR Exchange

**New Feature:** Direct coin exchange to INR in wallet

**New Exchange Rate:**
- **2000 coins = ₹100** (changed from 300 coins = ₹100)
- **Minimum: 20,000 coins** (changed from 3,000 coins)

**Created Files:**
1. `src/app/actions/wallet-exchange-actions.ts` - Backend logic
2. `src/app/wallet/exchange/page.tsx` - Exchange UI

**Features:**
- **Exchange Form:**
  - Coin amount input (must be divisible by 2000)
  - Bank account details (account number, IFSC, holder name)
  - Account number confirmation
  - Real-time INR calculation
  
- **Exchange History:**
  - View all past exchanges
  - Status tracking (pending, processing, completed, cancelled)
  - Cancel pending exchanges
  
- **Security:**
  - Stores only last 4 digits of account number
  - Validates IFSC code (11 characters)
  - Validates account number length (9-18 digits)
  - Confirms account number match

**Actions Available:**
```typescript
exchangeCoinsToINR(coinAmount, bankDetails)
getExchangeHistory()
cancelExchange(transactionId)
```

**Transaction Flow:**
1. User enters coin amount and bank details
2. System validates amount and details
3. Creates transaction with `type: 'coin_exchange'`
4. Deducts coins from wallet
5. Marks as 'pending' for manual processing
6. Admin processes and transfers INR

---

### 3. Exchange Rate Update

**Changed Constants in `src/app/actions/payout-actions.ts`:**

**Before:**
```typescript
const EXCHANGE_RATE = 300 // 300 coins = ₹100
const MINIMUM_COINS = 3000 // Minimum payout
```

**After:**
```typescript
const EXCHANGE_RATE = 2000 // 2000 coins = ₹100
const MINIMUM_COINS = 20000 // Minimum payout
```

**Impact:**
- Writer earnings page (payout section)
- Wallet exchange page
- All coin-to-INR conversions

## UI Updates

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates Needed:

The system uses existing `transactions` table with:
```sql
type: 'coin_exchange'
coin_amount: -20000 (negative for withdrawal)
amount: 100 (INR amount)
payment_status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'
metadata: {
  exchange_type: 'coins_to_inr',
  exchange_rate: 2000,
  rupees_per_unit: 100,
  bank_details: {
    account_number: '****1234', // last 4 digits
    ifsc_code: 'SBIN0001234',
    account_holder_name: 'John Doe'
  },
  cancelled_at: '2025-10-27T...' // if cancelled
}
```

**No migration required** - uses existing structure!

---

## Razorpay Integration

### Current Status:
- Exchange requests are saved to database
- Marked as 'pending' for manual processing

### For Razorpay Payout API:

**To enable automatic bank transfers**, you'll need to:

1. **Enable Razorpay Payouts** in your dashboard
2. **Get Payout API credentials**
3. **Add environment variables:**
   ```env
   RAZORPAY_PAYOUT_KEY_ID=your_payout_key
   RAZORPAY_PAYOUT_KEY_SECRET=your_payout_secret
   ```

4. **Update `wallet-exchange-actions.ts`** (after TODO comment):
   ```typescript
   // After successful transaction creation:
   const razorpay = new Razorpay({
     key_id: process.env.RAZORPAY_PAYOUT_KEY_ID,
     key_secret: process.env.RAZORPAY_PAYOUT_KEY_SECRET
   })

   const payout = await razorpay.payouts.create({
     account_number: "your_account_number",
     fund_account_id: "fa_xxx", // Create fund account first
     amount: inrAmount * 100, // paise
     currency: "INR",
     mode: "IMPS", // or NEFT/RTGS
     purpose: "payout",
     queue_if_low_balance: false,
   })
   ```

5. **Fund Account Creation** (one-time per user):
   ```typescript
   const fundAccount = await razorpay.fundAccounts.create({
     contact_id: "cont_xxx",
     account_type: "bank_account",
     bank_account: {
       name: accountHolderName,
       ifsc: ifscCode,
       account_number: accountNumber
     }
   })
   ```

**For now:** Manual processing is set up. You can:
1. View pending exchanges in Supabase
2. Process bank transfers manually
3. Update status to 'completed' when done

## Support

**Exchange Request Format in Database:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "type": "coin_exchange",
  "amount": 100,
  "coin_amount": -20000,
  "description": "Coin exchange: 20000 coins → ₹100",
  "payment_status": "pending",
  "metadata": {
    "exchange_type": "coins_to_inr",
    "exchange_rate": 2000,
    "rupees_per_unit": 100,
    "bank_details": {

    }
  }
}
```

**To Process Manually:**
