# NoobWriter Platform - Updates Summary

## Date: $(date)

## Overview
This document summarizes all the improvements and fixes made to the NoobWriter platform, addressing library functionality, tipping system, premium chapters, and UI enhancements.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Library Functionality Fixed

### Problem
- The "Add to Library" button on series pages was non-functional
- Clicking it only toggled local state without saving to database
- No server action existed to manage favorites

### Solution
Created complete favorites system:

**New Server Actions** (`src/app/actions/reader-actions.ts`):
- `toggleFavorite(seriesId)` - Add/remove series from user's favorites
- `checkIsFavorited(seriesId)` - Check if series is already favorited

**Updated Components**:
- `src/app/series/[id]/SeriesDetailClient.tsx`:
  - Added `favoriteLoading` state for better UX
  - Calls `checkIsFavorited()` on page load
  - Calls `toggleFavorite()` when button clicked
  - Shows "Saving..." state during operation
  - Properly displays filled heart icon when favorited

**Database Table**: Uses existing `favorites` table with columns:
- `id` (uuid)
- `user_id` (uuid, foreign key to profiles)
- `series_id` (uuid, foreign key to series)
- `created_at` (timestamp)

## 2. ‚úÖ Tipping System Implemented

### New Features
Readers can now send tips to authors from multiple locations:

**Server Actions** (`src/app/actions/wallet-actions.ts`):
- `sendTip(recipientId, amount, seriesId?, chapterId?)` - Send coins to author
- `getWalletBalance()` - Get current user's coin balance

**New Component** (`src/components/tip/TipButton.tsx`):
- Reusable tip button with modal dialog
- Preset amounts: 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 coins
- Custom amount input option
- Balance checking before sending
- Link to purchase more coins if insufficient
- Success animation after sending
- Error handling with clear messages

**Locations**:
1. **End of each chapter** (`NovelReaderClient.tsx`):
   - Shows "Enjoyed this chapter?" section after content
   - Includes author name and tip button
   - Automatically links tip to specific chapter

2. **Series detail page** (`SeriesDetailClient.tsx`):
   - Tip button in action buttons row
   - Allows supporting author for entire series

**Transaction Flow**:
1. Check sender has sufficient balance
2. Deduct coins from sender's wallet
3. Add coins to recipient's wallet (author)
4. Create transaction record for sender (type: `tip_sent`)
5. Create transaction record for recipient (type: `tip_received`)
6. If any step fails, rollback previous changes

## 3. ‚úÖ Premium Chapter System Fixed

### Server Actions
Updated `src/app/actions/wallet-actions.ts`:
- `unlockPremiumChapter(chapterId, price)` - Full unlock flow

Updated `src/app/actions/unlock-actions.ts`:
- Simplified to use `unlockPremiumChapter()` from wallet-actions
- Fixed table name from `unlocked_chapters` to `chapter_unlocks`
- Added proper revalidation after unlock

**Unlock Flow**:
1. Check if chapter already unlocked
2. Get chapter details and author ID
3. Verify user has sufficient coins
4. Deduct coins from reader
5. Add coins to author
6. Create unlock record in `chapter_unlocks` table
7. Create transactions for both parties
8. Revalidate page to show unlocked content

**Transaction Types**:
- Reader: `chapter_unlock` (negative amount)
- Author: `chapter_sale` (positive amount)

**Existing UI**:
The unlock modal (`UnlockPremiumModal`) already exists and properly uses these actions.
