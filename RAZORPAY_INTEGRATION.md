# Razorpay Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What's Been Implemented

### âœ… Full Razorpay Payment Gateway Integration

Now when users click "Buy Now", they will see the **official Razorpay payment modal** instead of directly adding coins.

## How It Works

### 1. User Clicks "Buy Now"
- Button shows "Buy Now with Razorpay"
- While loading: "Loading Payment..."
- While processing: "Processing..."

### 2. Razorpay Order Created
- Server creates order with Razorpay API
- Order includes: amount, currency (INR), receipt number
- Returns order ID for payment

### 3. Razorpay Modal Opens
- Beautiful payment popup appears
- Shows package details and price
- User can pay with:
  - **Credit/Debit Cards**
  - **UPI** (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm)
  - **Net Banking**
  - **Wallets**

### 4. Payment Processing
- User completes payment in Razorpay modal
- Razorpay verifies payment
- Returns payment ID and signature

### 5. Verification & Coin Addition
- Server verifies payment signature (security)
- Updates wallet with coins
- Creates transaction record
- Shows success message with new balance

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **New Server Actions** âœ…
**File**: `src/app/actions/payment-actions.ts`

**Functions**:
- `createRazorpayOrder()` - Creates order with Razorpay API
- `verifyRazorpayPayment()` - Verifies payment signature and adds coins

### 2. **Buy Coins Page Updated** âœ…
**File**: `src/app/wallet/buy-coins/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Loads Razorpay checkout script
- Opens Razorpay modal on "Buy Now"
- Handles payment success/failure
- Shows proper loading states
- Button text: "Buy Now with Razorpay"

### 3. **Razorpay Config** âœ…
**File**: `src/lib/razorpay/config.ts` (already existed)

- Razorpay client configuration
- Coin packages with pricing

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure your `.env` or `.env.local` has:

```env
# Razorpay Test Keys (for development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# For production, use live keys:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
# RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Testing with Test Mode

Razorpay provides test cards for development:

### Test Cards (No Real Money):

**Success Card**:
- Card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
- CVV: Any 3 digits
- Expiry: Any future date
- Name: Any name

**Failure Card**:
- Card: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- Will simulate payment failure

### Test UPI:
- UPI ID: `success@razorpay`
- Will simulate successful payment

```

## Security Features

### 1. **Signature Verification** âœ…
- Every payment is verified using HMAC SHA256
- Prevents fake payment confirmations
- Formula: `HMAC(order_id + "|" + payment_id, secret_key)`

### 2. **Server-Side Processing** âœ…
- All wallet updates happen on server
- Client can't directly add coins
- RLS policies enforce user authorization

### 3. **Transaction Records** âœ…
- Every purchase is logged with:
  - Razorpay order ID
  - Razorpay payment ID
  - Payment signature
  - Amount paid (rupees)
  - Coins received
  - Timestamp
