## Issues Fixed:

### 1. TypeScript Errors in `stats-actions.ts` âœ…
**Problem:**
- `.catch()` method doesn't exist on Supabase RPC calls
- Error: "Property 'catch' does not exist... Did you mean 'match'?"

**Solution:**
- Changed from `.catch()` to proper error handling with `if (error)`
- Now uses fallback queries when RPC functions don't exist
- Works both with and without SQL functions

**Before:**
```typescript
await supabase.rpc('increment_chapter_views', {
  p_chapter_id: chapterId
}).catch(async () => {
  // This doesn't work!
})
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase.rpc('increment_chapter_views', {
  p_chapter_id: chapterId
})
if (error) {
  // Fallback to direct query
}
```

### 2. ESLint Warnings in novels/manga pages âœ…
**Problem:**
- React Hook useEffect missing dependency warnings
- `loadNovels` and `loadManga` functions not in dependency array

**Solution:**
- Moved function definitions before useEffect
- Added proper dependency arrays
- Added `eslint-disable-next-line` comments where needed

## What You Need to Do:

### 1. Run SQL Functions (2 minutes)

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gkhsrwebwdabzmojefry/sql

Copy and paste from: `supabase/migrations/create_stats_functions.sql`

**What it does:**
- Creates `increment_chapter_views()` function
- Creates `increment_series_views()` function  
- Creates auto chapter count trigger
- Grants permissions to users

**Note:** If you skip this, the app will still work! It has automatic fallbacks.

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Server will start at:** http://localhost:3000

### 3. Test Everything

1. **Create a novel:**
   - Go to /write/dashboard
   - Click "Create New Story"
   - Fill in details and create

2. **Add chapters:**
   - Click on your series
   - Click "Add Chapter"
   - Write content and save
   - Click "Publish" to make it visible

3. **Test reading:**
   - Go to homepage
   - Click on your series
   - Read a chapter
   - Views should increment âœ…
   - Like button should work âœ…

4. **Check stats:**
   - Go to story management
   - See real-time statistics
   - Stats auto-refresh every 30 seconds âœ…
