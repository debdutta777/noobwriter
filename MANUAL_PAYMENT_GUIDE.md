5. ‚úÖ Admin confirms payment in system
6. ‚úÖ **Coins are deducted ONLY after admin confirms**
7. ‚úÖ Status changes to "COMPLETED"

## üìù Step-by-Step Admin Guide

### Daily Process:

1. **Check for New Requests**
   ```
   Go to: https://yoursite.com/admin/exchanges
   ```

2. **For Each Request:**
   
   a. **Copy Payment Details**
   - Click copy buttons for:
     - Account holder name
     - Account number
     - IFSC code
     - UPI ID (if provided)

   b. **Transfer Money**
   - Open your banking app
   - Use NEFT/IMPS/RTGS or UPI
   - Transfer exact INR amount
   - Note the UTR/Transaction ID

   c. **Confirm in System**
   - Click "Process Payment"
   - Select payment method
   - Enter transaction reference
   - Click "Confirm Payment Sent"

3. **System Actions:**
   - Coins deducted from author's wallet
   - Status updated to "completed"
   - Record saved with your confirmation

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Coin Deduction Fails:

**Error:** "Failed to deduct coins"

**Causes:**
- Author spent coins after requesting
- Insufficient balance now

**Solution:**
- Contact author
- Ask them to top up balance
- Or reduce exchange amount
- Then try confirming again

### If Payment Already Sent But Confirm Failed:

**Scenario:** You transferred money but system error on confirm

**Solution:**
1. Check transaction status in Supabase
2. If still "pending", try confirming again
3. If failed multiple times:
   - Manually update in Supabase:
   ```sql
   UPDATE transactions 
   SET payment_status = 'completed',
       coin_amount = -20000
   WHERE id = 'transaction_id';
   
   -- Then deduct coins manually
   SELECT deduct_coins('user_id', 20000);
   ```

### User Cancelled After You Sent Money:

**Prevention:** Always confirm in system BEFORE transferring

**If it happens:**
- Contact user for refund
- Or keep as credit for next request

---

## üìä Reports & Tracking

### View All Exchanges in Supabase:

```sql
-- All pending exchanges
SELECT 
  t.*,
  p.display_name,
  p.email
FROM transactions t
JOIN profiles p ON t.user_id = p.id
WHERE t.type = 'coin_exchange'
  AND t.payment_status = 'pending'
ORDER BY t.created_at ASC;

-- Completed exchanges (last 30 days)
SELECT 
  t.*,
  p.display_name,
  p.email
FROM transactions t
JOIN profiles p ON t.user_id = p.id
WHERE t.type = 'coin_exchange'
  AND t.payment_status = 'completed'
  AND t.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC;

-- Total paid this month
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_exchanges,
  SUM(amount) as total_inr,
  SUM(ABS(coin_amount)) as total_coins
FROM transactions
WHERE type = 'coin_exchange'
  AND payment_status = 'completed'
  AND created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW());
```

## ‚ú® Benefits of Manual Processing

### ‚úÖ Advantages:

1. **No Company Registration Needed**
   - Perfect for startups/individuals
   - No legal compliance overhead

2. **No Payment Gateway Fees**
   - Razorpay charges 2% + GST
   - Direct transfer = zero fees

3. **Full Control**
   - Review each request
   - Prevent fraud/abuse
   - Verify user identity

4. **Flexible Payment Methods**
   - Bank transfer
   - UPI
   - Any method you prefer

5. **Better Cash Flow**
   - Process when you have funds
   - No automated payouts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations:

1. **Manual Work**
   - Need to process each request
   - Takes time for transfers

2. **Processing Delay**
   - 1-3 business days typical
   - Not instant like Razorpay

3. **Scaling**
   - Fine for <100 requests/month
   - Consider automation if volume grows

---

## üîÑ Migration to Automated (Future)

**If you later want to automate:**

1. Register company
2. Get Razorpay Payout API access
3. Update `confirmExchangePayment()` function
4. Add Razorpay payout code
5. Existing data structure compatible!

**No changes needed to:**
- Database schema
- User interface
- Exchange request flow
