### üîß 3. Reader Review/Rating System Fix

**Status:** IN PROGRESS ‚öôÔ∏è

**Issue Identified:**
The `createOrUpdateRating` function uses Supabase's `upsert` operation, which requires both INSERT and UPDATE permissions. The original RLS policies didn't properly handle upsert operations.

**Solution Created:**
- New migration file: `supabase/migrations/20251028_fix_rating_upsert_policy.sql`
- Updated RLS policies to support upsert operations
- Added proper WITH CHECK clauses

**‚ö†Ô∏è ACTION REQUIRED:**
You need to apply this migration in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gkhsrwebwdabzmojefry)
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20251028_fix_rating_upsert_policy.sql`
4. Click **Run**
5. Verify with: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'ratings';`
