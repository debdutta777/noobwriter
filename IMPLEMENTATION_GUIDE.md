## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Supabase Storage Migration

1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Copy contents from `RUN_THIS_STORAGE_MIGRATION.sql`
5. Execute the SQL
6. Verify bucket created:
   - Go to **Storage** in sidebar
   - Should see `covers` bucket
   - Click on it to verify it's public

**Expected Result:**
```
Bucket: covers
Status: Public
Size Limit: 5MB
Allowed Types: image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/png, image/webp
```

### Step 2: Test Cover Upload

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Login to your account
3. Navigate to `/write/story/new`
4. Fill in Step 1 (Basic Info)
5. Upload a cover image:
   - Click the upload area
   - Select a portrait image (e.g., 800x1200px)
   - Wait for upload to complete
   - Should see preview
6. Complete the wizard
7. Verify cover appears on series page

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Upload fails**: Check Supabase storage bucket exists and RLS policies are set
- **Wrong aspect ratio error**: Use portrait image (2:3 ratio)
- **File too large**: Reduce to under 5MB

### Step 3: Test Homepage

1. Navigate to `/` (homepage)
2. Should see loading spinner briefly
3. Should see 3 new sections:
   - Recommended for You
   - Recently Updated
   - Top by Category

**If sections don't appear:**
- Check if you have published series in your database
- Verify series table has data with `status = 'published'`
- Check browser console for errors

**Supabase Quick Data Check:**
```sql
-- Check if you have published series
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM series WHERE status = 'published';

-- Should return > 0 for sections to appear
```

### Step 4: Test Library Page

Follow the comprehensive guide in `LIBRARY_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

**Quick Test:**
1. Login to your account
2. Navigate to `/library`
3. Check all 4 stats cards show numbers
4. Test each tab (Continue Reading, Favorites, History)
5. Click quick action buttons

**Expected:**
- Page loads without errors
- Stats display correctly
- Tabs switch smoothly
- Navigation works

## API Reference

### CoverUpload Component

```tsx
<CoverUpload
  currentCoverUrl?: string           // Optional: existing cover URL
  onUploadComplete: (url: string) => void  // Callback with uploaded URL
  aspectRatio?: 'portrait' | 'square'      // Default: 'portrait'
/>
```

**Example:**
```tsx
<CoverUpload
  currentCoverUrl={formData.cover_url}
  onUploadComplete={(url) => setFormData({ ...formData, cover_url: url })}
  aspectRatio="portrait"
/>
```

### SeriesCard Component

```tsx
<SeriesCard
  series: SeriesCardType             // Required: series data
  showStats?: boolean                // Default: true
  compact?: boolean                  // Default: false (use for rankings)
/>
```

**Example:**
```tsx
// Regular card
<SeriesCard series={seriesData} />

// Compact card (for rankings)
<SeriesCard series={seriesData} compact />
```

### Homepage Actions

```ts
// Get all homepage data (recommended + recent + rankings)
const data = await getHomepageData()

// Individual actions
const recommended = await getRecommendedSeries(6)
const recentlyUpdated = await getRecentlyUpdatedSeries(6)
const categoryRankings = await getCategoryRankings()
```

---

## Environment Variables Required

Verify these are set in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://gkhsrwebwdabzmojefry.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

---

## Database Requirements

### Tables Used:
- `series` - All stories/manga
- `chapters` - Chapter count
- `profiles` - Author information
- `favorites` - User favorites
- `reading_progress` - User reading history
- `transactions` - Coin transactions
- `storage.buckets` - Cover image storage
- `storage.objects` - Uploaded files

### Required Columns:
**series table:**
- `id`, `title`, `cover_url`, `synopsis`, `content_type`
- `status` (must be 'published' to appear)
- `genres` (array)
- `view_count`, `average_rating`, `total_ratings`
- `updated_at`, `author_id`

---

## Performance Considerations

### Homepage Loading
- Uses Suspense for progressive loading
- Server-side rendering for SEO
- Fetches all sections in parallel with `Promise.all()`
- Limits results (6 recommended, 6 recent, 5 per category)

### Cover Upload
- 5MB file size limit
- Client-side image validation
- Aspect ratio check before upload
- Public bucket for fast CDN delivery

### Caching (Future Enhancement)
Consider adding:
```ts
export const revalidate = 3600 // Revalidate every hour
```
to homepage for better performance.
